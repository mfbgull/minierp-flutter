# Goal Workflow DOX

Goal documents use YAML front matter followed by an objective, boundaries, target conditions, current evidence, planning history, review history, and progress log. A goal is a long-term, recurring, or multi-round outcome. It is not a large task: it coordinates finite tasks and is completed only by a distinct evidence-based review against its bar.

Spynel owns `first_assigned_at` and `provider_iterations`: the former is set on the first real planning claim, while the latter increments under a cross-process lock immediately before each provider dispatch, recovery, control, or continuation. Agents must preserve both fields and must not repurpose planning/review attempt counters as provider iterations.

Required front matter: `id`, `title`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, non-negative integer `round`, non-empty `success_criteria`, and `review_trigger`. Each success criterion has a stable `id`, measurable `condition`, and `evidence_required`. `review_trigger` is `all_round_tasks_settled`, `all_round_tasks_settled_or_checkpoint`, or `scheduled`. Default to settlement-only. Any new `next_review_at` requires a valid RFC 3339 time plus non-empty `checkpoint_reason`; use it only for a concrete, short, outcome-appropriate active-round checkpoint. A precise external dependency belongs in `waiting` with `wake_at`. A checkpoint is consulted only while the goal is `active`; once the goal enters `review`, its retained value is durable round history and never delays the review claim.

Default statuses:

- `proposed`: captured and eligible for its initial planning claim.
- `planning`: claimed by a planning lease to refine the bar and create the next linked task round.
- `active`: no goal agent owns the file; Spynel observes current-round tasks and checkpoints.
- `review`: the round settled or a checkpoint arrived, so independent goal review is queued.
- `reviewing`: claimed from `review` by a fresh goal-review lease and session.
- `waiting`: deliberately paused until a documented condition or `wake_at`; `resume_status` records whether it returns to planning or review.
- `done`: a goal review proved every required success criterion.
- `abandoned`: deliberately ended without satisfying the bar.

The normal lifecycle is `proposed -> planning -> active -> review -> reviewing`. A review moves to `done`, `waiting`, `abandoned`, or back to `planning` for another round. Planning and reviewing always have separate leases and sessions. The reviewer records criterion verdicts but never implements work or creates tasks; a continuing review hands the goal to a new planning session.

Planning creates focused task files in `tasks/todo/` with the goal's `id` as `goal_id` and the next integer as `goal_round`. It follows `harness.reviews`: `always` forces task review, `never` forces direct task completion, and `skip-trivial` chooses `review_required` per task by expected value. In `skip-trivial`, broad, high-risk, hard-to-reverse, security-sensitive, data/schema, infrastructure, deployment, release, migration, or materially uncertain work normally requires review; read-only work and minor, localized, easily reversible changes with clear verification may complete directly. Goal derivation alone never forces review. The planner verifies the complete batch, records its exact stable IDs in `round_task_ids`, then commits that round on the goal and moves it to `active`. Task IDs—not moving paths—are durable references, and Spynel rejects activation when the declared cohort differs from the linked task documents. Spynel resolves every round from the fixed `.spynel/tasks/` status folders. `active` carries no goal lease. Spynel moves it to `review` when all tasks in the current round are settled (`done`, `failed`, or `cancelled`) or a configured checkpoint is due. Task completion alone never completes a goal, regardless of task review mode.

A goal may enter `done` only from `reviewing` with `last_review.verdict: done`, `last_review.criteria_satisfied: true`, the reviewed round, an exact clock-derived review time, and criterion-by-criterion evidence in the body. Never weaken success criteria to justify completion.
